# Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization
As a member of the Data Scientist team, I have the responsibility to provide insights related to hotel business performance. These insights can be sought through data exploration, such as analyzing how customers behave in booking hotel tickets or looking for factors that influence the cancellation of hotel ticket bookings. Then I present the insights obtained using visualization and data story telling. Some of the stages and analysis carried out are:
- Data preprocessing
- Monthly hotel booking analysis based on hotel type
- impact analysis of stay duration on hotel booking cancellations rate
- impact analysis of lead time on hotel bookings cancellations rate

beberapa insight yang didapatkan adalah : 
- June, July, and August are the peak months for hotel bookings.
- These two types of hotels reached the highest bookings in July for city hotels at 11.18% (4092 bookings) and in June for resort hotels at 9.63% (1760 bookings). this can occur due to the holiday season for schools.
- An increase in hotel booking trend also occurred in December, which amounted to 10.32% (3777 bookings) for city hotels and 9.61% for hotel resorts (1755 bookings). This can occur due to the Christmas and New Year holidays.
- - There is a positive correlation between the booking cancellation ratio and the duration of stay for each hotel type. The longer the duration of stay, the higher the booking cancellation ratio.
- The most canceled duration of stay for city hotels occurs at the duration of 4 weeks (87.23%). While the most canceled duration of stay for resort hotels occurs in the duration of 3 weeks (46.75%).
- There are several possibilities as to why this might happen. Some examples include sudden emergencies that have to be canceled, vacation plans that have changed, or purely human errors.
- - Both types of hotels have the lowest cancellation rate at a lead time of 1 month (city hotel =22.47%, resort hotel = 13.11%)
- Both types of hotel also have the highest cancellation rate at a lead time of 11-12 months (city hotel = 78.11%, resort hotel = 45.48%).
- Significant growth in cancelation rate occurs when the lead time passes 1 month.
- This growth can happen because there are initially many vacation plans that have not been thought of, but with the length of the lead time, there are more possible vacation plans that could cause the original plan to shift and have an impact on hotel bookings.
