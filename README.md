# Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization
As a member of the Data Scientist team, I have the responsibility to provide insights related to hotel business performance. These insights can be sought through data exploration, such as analyzing how customers behave in booking hotel tickets or looking for factors that influence the cancellation of hotel ticket bookings. Then I present the insights obtained using visualization and data story telling. Some of the stages and analysis carried out are:
- Data preprocessing
- Monthly hotel booking analysis based on hotel type
- impact analysis of stay duration on hotel booking cancellations rate
- impact analysis of lead time on hotel bookings cancellations rate
